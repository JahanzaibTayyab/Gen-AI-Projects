# Using OpenAI Completions API, Streamlit, and Shelve

Please note we have built this app for a single user.

You are assigned the task of improving the code to support
multiple users. For this you will need to store message histroy in a external storage place by making changes in 
the database.py file. You may also have to assign a User ID
to each user.
